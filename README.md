So within this project i wanted to create a simple calculator that calculated my scores obtained from my apple watch fitness, and placed them on a 0-100 scale of completing each section (Calories, Active Minutes, Stand). 
With the help of tkinter and python, i was able to create this first app that i have ever completed. Please enjoy.
